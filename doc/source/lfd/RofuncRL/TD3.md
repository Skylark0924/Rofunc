# RofuncRL TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)

## Algorithm 

## Performance comparison

We compare the performance of the TD3 algorithm with different tricks and an open source baseline 
([SKRL](https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl/tree/main)). These experiments were conducted on the `Pendulum` environment. 
The results are shown below:
