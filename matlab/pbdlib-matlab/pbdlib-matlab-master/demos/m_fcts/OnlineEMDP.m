function [ model,N ] = OnlineEMDP( N,P,MinSigma,model,lambda )
% Online clustering with DP Means
% This function updates a Gaussian Mixture Model by using an extended version of DPMEANS algorithm. 
% 
% Variables

% P: 		current point
% MinSigma :	minimum covariance for regularization
% model :	GMM model containing
% 				model.Mu :		Mean
