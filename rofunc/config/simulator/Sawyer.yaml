  # If the collision filter for the actor is set to -1,
  # the actor will use filters loaded in by the asset loaders.
  # This is important for MJCF files that specify non-zero contypes/conaffinities
  # or have other contacts specified. Setting the collision filter to 0 will
  # enable collisions between all shapes in the actor. Setting the collision filter
  # to anything > 0 will disable all self collisions.
