Rofunc package focuses on the **robotic Imitation Learning (IL) and Learning from Demonstration (LfD)** fields and
provides valuable and convenient python functions for robotics, including _demonstration collection, data
pre-processing, LfD algorithms, planning, and control methods_. We also provide an Isaac Gym-based robot simulator for
evaluation. This package aims to advance the field by building a full-process toolkit and validation platform that
simplifies and standardizes the process of demonstration data collection, processing, learning, and its deployment on
robots.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI (stable version)

The installation is very easy,

```
pip install rofunc
```

and as you'll find later, it's easy to use as well!

```python
import rofunc as rf
```

Thus, have fun in the robotics world!
> **Note**
> Several requirements need to be installed before using the package. Please refer to
> the [installation guide](https://rofunc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation) for more details.

### Install from Source (nightly version)

```python
git clone https://github.com/Skylark0924/Rofunc.git
cd Rofunc

# Create a conda environment
# Python 3.8 is strongly recommended
conda create -n rofunc python=3.8

# For Linux user
sh ./scripts/install.sh
# For MacOS user (Isaac Gym based simulator is not supported on MacOS)
sh ./scripts/mac_install.sh
```

> **Note**
> If you want to use functions related to ZED camera, you need to
> install [ZED SDK](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/#downloads) manually. (We have tried to package it as
> a `.whl` file to add it to `requirements.txt`, unfortunately, the ZED SDK is not very friendly and doesn't support
> direct installation.)

> **Note**
> Currently, we provide a simple document; please refer to [here](./rofunc/).
> A comprehensive one with both English and Chinese versions is built via
> the [readthedoc](https://rofunc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
> We provide a simple but interesting example: learning to play
> Taichi by learning from human demonstration.

To give you a quick overview of the pipeline of `rofunc`, we provide an interesting example of learning to play Taichi
from human demonstration. You can find it in the [Quick start](https://rofunc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
section of the documentation.

The available functions and plans can be found as follows.
